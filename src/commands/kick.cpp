/*
KICK message
      Command: KICK
   Parameters: <channel> <user> *( "," <user> ) [<comment>]
The KICK command can be used to request the forced removal of a user from a
channel. It causes the <user> to be removed from the <channel> by force.

This message may be sent from a server to a client to notify the client that
someone has been removed from a channel. In this case, the message <source> will
be the client who sent the kick, and <channel> will be the channel which the
target client has been removed from.

If no comment is given, the server SHOULD use a default message instead.

Servers MUST NOT send multiple users in this message to clients, and MUST
distribute these multiple-user KICK messages as a series of messages with a
single user name on each. This is necessary to maintain backward compatibility
with existing client software. If a KICK message is distributed in this way,
<comment> (if it exists) should be on each of these messages.

Servers MAY limit the number of target users per KICK command via the TARGMAX
parameter of RPL_ISUPPORT, and silently drop targets if the number of targets
exceeds the limit.

ERR_USERNOTINCHANNEL (441)
  "<client> <nick> <channel> :They aren't on that channel"
Returned when a client tries to perform a channel+nick affecting command, when
the nick isnâ€™t joined to the channel (for example, MODE #channel +o nick).


KICKLEN Parameter
  Format: KICKLEN=<length>
The KICKLEN parameter indicates the maximum length for the <reason> of a KICK
command. If a KICK <reason> has more characters than this parameter, it may be
silently truncated by the server before being passed on to other clients.
Clients MAY receive a KICK <reason> that has more characters than this
parameter.

The value MUST be specified and MUST be a positive integer.

Examples:

  KICKLEN=255

  KICKLEN=307*/
